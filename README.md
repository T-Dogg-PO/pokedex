# Pokedex
This website is a Pokedex designed to display a list of Pokemon as buttons. Upon clicking those buttons, a modal will pop up with details about that Pokemon. [The website can be found here](https://t-dogg-po.github.io/pokedex/).

## Usage
### Landing Page
The website will default to showing a list of Generation 1 Pokemon. Click on any of the buttons to bring up a modal that displays some basic details about that Pokemon.

### Filter the List by Pokemon Generation
Click on the 'Select a Generation of Pokemon' button in the navbar to bring up a list of Generations. Clicking on one of these will change the selection of Pokemon on the page to correspond to that generation.

### Search for a Pokemon by Name
Click on the search box in the top right corner of the page and begin typing out a Pokemon name. The list of Pokemon displayed on the page will change with each keypress to correspond to the search results.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using vanilla JavaScript (so far at least), and using data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
